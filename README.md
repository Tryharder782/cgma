## Key Technical Features

* **Interactive 3D Rendering:** Utilizes **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber** to render and control the 3D model directly in the browser.
* **Camera Controls:** Implemented smooth camera controls allowing users to zoom, pan, and rotate the model to view it from any angle.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with React, demonstrating how complex 3D scenes can be integrated into a modern front-end framework.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to explore the capabilities of WebGL-based 3D graphics in an educational context. It serves as a strong example of my ability to work with complex libraries and create engaging user experiences beyond standard web forms and pages.
